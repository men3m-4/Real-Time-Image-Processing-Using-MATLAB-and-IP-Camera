# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-MATLAB-and-IP-Camera
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using MATLAB in conjunction with an IP Camera. It captures live video, processes each frame, detects objects, removes noise, and visualizes the results by drawing bounding boxes around the detected objects
