# Real-Time Image Processing Using MATLAB and IP Camera

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using **MATLAB** in conjunction with an **IP Camera**. It captures live video, processes each frame,  removes noise, and visualizes the results by drawing bounding boxes around the detected objects.


---

## 🎯 Objective
To detect and highlight objects in real-time video streams using MATLAB and an IP camera.
